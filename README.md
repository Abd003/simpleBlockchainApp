# simpleBlockchainApp
The code is basically a simple implementation of a blockchain structure in an android application. The blockchain class stores an array of blocks and initializes the initial block itself. In MainActivity, we simply display the blocks in the chain along with validation of the chain and an option to add further blocks to the chain. The blocks can be edited by clicking on it which takes you to EditBlock class while you can add a new block by simply clicking the “+” button at the bottom of your screen which will take you to AddBlock class. After every change, the system will check whether the chain is valid or not and will display the message at the bottom of your home screen. The working of the code is given in a video which is uploaded at YouTube. The link to the video is : https://youtu.be/QXsR8mIGkzw
